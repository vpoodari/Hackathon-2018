# Hackathon-2018
This program was written for the 2018 CruzHacks competition. This program reads in a TSV file containing BRCA1/BRCA2 variants along with their frequency in the general population and prior probability of cancer occuring. The Python program uses matplotlib to plot data from the TSV file as a scatterplot. The user can also provide a specific varient for either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene and a bar graph that shows prior probability and varient frequency are drawn as well as an indicated point in the scatterplot.

This program runs through sys.argv using python hack.py tsvfile "Varient" Gene#
